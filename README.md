# ModernOpenGL
This repository holds the pdf presentation for the Modern OpenGL talk I gave to students enrolled in the \
Graphics course, of the Computer Science Department of AUTh.

The main focus is to aid people with some experience in the old OpenGL API make a smooth transition to \
the modern (Core Profile) OpenGL API and practices.

If you have any feedback or recommendations to improve this presentation, please let me know via email \
